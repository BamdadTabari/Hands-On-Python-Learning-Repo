# shut up!!!! 
# written by Interrupted girl :

# important note. these codes are adopted from two sources. I must mention them and say thanks a lot for giving me the knowledge of "REAL PYTHON" 

# 0-play-ground, it's my playground!!!!

# 1-lessons is for a course from LinkedIn, LinkedIn banned me 3 times. I'm tired of that. fuck it

> Before going for number 2 I must say two things. first, fuck all the platforms that threaten me like trash. because I am Persian. You all MUST FUCKING LISTEN TO ME I'M PERSIAN AND GONNA FUCK YOU ONE BY ONE MOTHER FUCKERS.  everyone hates me. even myself. I planned my suicide. I WILL SHOW ALL OF YOU THE REAL 0&1.
(are you scared now?) no. cause I'm kidding with you. I'm not mad at anyone, except for Bamdad and Mohammad Javad. but really, be nice we all are human, do not ban Iranian people from your sites. we are not terrorists. am I kidding? It doesn't matter at all. \n  So let's go for number 2 :
# and the second source is for a man who wrote a book. and its: 
> SECOND EDITION of Introducing Python Modern Computing in Simple Packages written by  Bill Lubanovic. For now, folder 666-pro-python of this repo is for part of this book. 
# Thanks a lot man for sharing your great knowledge. I own you one.

# Finally folders 2 and 3. Read these. Do not forget to watch the playground cause life is a game with one shot.

# I hope GitHub, is a little different and does not clean this.
